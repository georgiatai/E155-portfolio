Referencing the STM32L432KC reference manual, programming manual, and datasheet, I was able to utilize functions to set up and enable the SPI. Specifically, port B was chosen as the pins for the SPI to avoid interfering with the UART pins in port A. To enable the SPI, I wrote the functions initSPI and spiSendReceive, which sets up the SPI following steps from the reference model and transmits a character over SPI while returning the received character, respectively.\nFunctions for the temperature sensor DS1722 was also written. According to the datasheet, the raw data stored in MSB and LSB was received by the SPI, and calculated to convert to a floating value of temperature. As per the design of the sensor, resolution from 8 to 12 bits can also be set through the initialization function.\nTo set up the ESP8266 web server, I simply modified the starter code provided as mentioned above, changing the looks of the webpage and adding functions related to the temperature sensors, such as buttons to control the resolution.\nThe circuitry design simply connects the desired pins of MCU to DS1722 and ESP8266.

    "section": "Prescalar Value Calculations",
    "text": "Prescalar Value Calculations\nThe formula for the ARR, the auto-reload value, or the number of cycles compared with the count, can be calculated by the following formulas. The ARR field in the registers has 16 bits. Therefore, \\(0 \\leq ARR \\leq 2^{16}-1=65535\\). The ARR value for duration can simply be calculated by the wait time multiplied by the frequency of the timer. Note that the wait time is inputted with an unit of milliseconds, and is thus scaled to seconds to comply with the timer frequency. Choosing a prescalar value of 4999 for the counter: \\[\nARR_{cnt} = \\frac{t}{1000} \\times f_{TIM} = \\frac{t}{1000} \\times \\frac{f_{clk}}{(PSC_{cnt} + 1)}\n\\]\nThe minimum duration is found when ARR has the smallest value possible, or \\(ARR=0\\): \\[\nARR_{cnt, min} = \\frac{t_{min}}{1000} \\times \\frac{80000000}{4999+1} = 0 \\Rightarrow t_{min} = 0 \\ ms\n\\]\nThe maximum duration is found when ARR has the largest value possible, or \\(ARR=65535\\): \\[\nARR_{cnt, max} = \\frac{t_{max}}{1000} \\times \\frac{80000000}{4999+1} = 65535 \\Rightarrow t_{max} = 4095.9375 \\ ms\n\\]\nTherefore, the duration which the system can take is from 0 to approximately 4096 ms. On the other hand, the maximum and minimum frequency which the device can play is calculated with the following equation, with a chosen prescalar value of 799: \\[\nf_{note} = \\frac{f_{TIM}}{ARR+1} = \\frac{f_{clk}}{PSC_{PWM}+1} \\times \\frac{1}{ARR+1}\n\\] \\[\n\\Rightarrow\nARR_{PWM} = \\frac{f_{clk}}{PSC_{PWM}+1} \\times \\frac{1}{f_{note}} - 1\n\\]\nThe minimum frequency is found when ARR has the largest value possible, or \\(ARR=65535\\): \\[\nARR_{PWM, max} = \\frac{80000000}{799+1} \\times \\frac{1}{f_{note, min}} - 1 = 65535 \\Rightarrow f_{note, min} \\approx 1.526 \\ Hz\n\\]\nThe maximum frequency is found when ARR has the smallest value possible, or \\(ARR=0\\): \\[\nARR_{PWM, min} = \\frac{80000000}{799+1} \\times \\frac{1}{f_{note, max}} - 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow f_{note, min} = 100000 \\ Hz\n\\]\nTherefore, the frequency which the system supports is from approximately 1.526 to 100000 Hz.\nFor the frequency range of 220 to 1000 Hz, which is commonly used for most music, we calculate the error of our device from the desired frequency. We also choose 600 Hz to better represent across the range. First, we can calculate the actual ARR value with our chosen PWM timer prescalar of 799, note that the number is treated as int and rounded to the nearest whole number: \\[\nARR_{PWM, 220Hz}  = \\frac{80000000}{799+1} \\times \\frac{1}{220} - 1  \\approx 453.54 \\approx 454\n\\] \\[\nARR_{PWM, 600Hz}  = \\frac{80000000}{799+1} \\times \\frac{1}{600} - 1  \\approx 165.67 \\approx 166 \\\\\n\\] \\[\nARR_{PWM, 1000Hz} = \\frac{80000000}{799+1} \\times \\frac{1}{1000} - 1 = 99\n\\]\nThe real PWM frequency produced by this ARR value is thus: \\[\nf_{220Hz, prod}  = \\frac{80000000}{799+1} \\times \\frac{1}{ARR_{PWM, 220Hz}  + 1} \\approx 219.780219\n\\] \\[\nf_{600Hz, prod}  = \\frac{80000000}{799+1} \\times \\frac{1}{ARR_{PWM, 600Hz}  + 1} \\approx 598.8024\n\\] \\[\nf_{1000Hz, prod} = \\frac{80000000}{799+1} \\times \\frac{1}{ARR_{PWM, 1000Hz} + 1} = 1000\n\\]\nThe error for each of these frequencies is: \\[\nerr_{220Hz}  = \\frac{f_{220Hz, prod}  - 220}{220}   \\approx -0.000999 \\approx -0.1\\%\n\\] \\[\nerr_{600Hz}  = \\frac{f_{600Hz, prod}  - 600}{600}   \\approx -0.001996 \\approx -0.2\\%\n\\] \\[\nerr_{1000Hz} = \\frac{f_{1000Hz, prod} - 1000}{1000} = 0\n\\]\nThe error for each frequencies is well below 1%, we can thus assume that the error will also be below 1% across the frequency range of 220 to 1000 Hz on the device."

But for your frequency range, a 16-bit timer (like TIM15/16/17) is more than enough.\n\n\nIt provided the formula to the correct timer frequency, however, the output frequency was different from what I expected by a factor of 2, as I believe that it was confusing the frequency with the duty cycle and the actual frequency of the note. For setting up the timers, it first suggested setting up RCC without much instructions, then PSC, ARR, CCRx, CCMRx, CCER, BDTR, GPIO_AFR, and CR1. The list pretty much covers what I have for making my device to work, but did not include EGR to update the events.\nAfter providing the reference manual and asking ChatGPT to confirm/modify its previous answer, it detailed the answer better, providing more keywords found in the manual, such as TIM2_CHx for the output channel of the timers, and explained better the mapping between the GPIO and the timers. It did not change anything about the formula, but did additionally mention EGR for as an optional step when setting up the timers."

    "section": "Design",
    "text": "Design\nThe top level design, lab2_gt, included three modules: the on-board high-speed oscillator (HSOSC) from the iCE40 UltraPlus primitive library, a clock divider to toggle or select between the digits shown on the display, and a 7-segment display decoder. The general idea of the design can be visualized with the block diagram below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Block diagram of the FPGA design\n\n\n\nThe clock divider, digitSelector, selects the digit which will be displayed on the dual 7-segment display with 60 Hz. The frequency was chosen such that the human eyes can not catch that the two digits are turning on and off, creating the illusion that both digits are always on at the same time. The module achieves such frequency by taking in a 48 MHz clock input clk given by the high-speed oscillator and using a counter incremented at each clock cycle to toggle the enabling signal for each digit at 60 Hz. It then outputs both enabling signals and the 4-bit binary of the digit with the enabled signal.\nThe 7-segment display decoder contains a set of combinational logic to translate a 4-bit binary signal into a single hexadecimal value. Each segment of the display is a LED controlled by an I/O pin from the UPduino board, and the shape of each hexadecimal value is unique. As per the constraint of this lab, this module is only used once and takes the 4-bit binary input of the selected digit given by digitSelector.\nIn terms of the circuitry design, the dual 7-segment display was externally accessed on a breadboard, with each of its two common anode connected to a 2N3906 PNP transistor to provide enough current. Other than the switch located on the PCB provided by the course, SW6, an external 4-input switch was also wired ono the breadboard. The switch on the PCB controls the left digit, whereas the one on the breadboard controls the right digit. The 5 LEDs for showing the sum are also connected on the breadboard. The schematics for the physical circuit design is shown in the following graph:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Schematics of the circuit design\n\n\n\nFor the LEDs display is the sum, I chose to use red LEDs, whose forward voltage is normally around 1.6 V. Aiming for around 5 mA of current, which should provide enough brightness and is well below the maximum current of both the I/O pin of the UPduino (8 mA, found in section 4.17 of the datasheet) and the LED (20 mA conventionally), the resistor values for each LED can be calculated with:\n\\[\nR_{LED} = \\frac{3.3V - 1.6V}{0.005A} = 340 \\Omega\n\\]\nThe closest resistor I found was \\(330 \\Omega\\), which should not affect the current much.\nThe datasheet of the 2N3906 transistor shows that it has a base-emitter saturation voltage of 0.65 to 0.85 V when the current through the base is 1 mA. Aiming for a current slightly smaller than that to ensure safety, say 0.8 mA, the resistor value is:\n\\[\nR_{transistor} = \\frac{V_{PIN} - V_{BE,SAT}}{I_{transistor}} = \\frac{3.3V - 0.65V}{0.007A} \\approx 380 \\Omega\n\\]\nThe closest resistor I found was \\(390 \\Omega\\), which should not affect the current much.\nA resistor value of \\(220 \\Omega\\) are chosen considering the voltage and current across the LEDs. According to the dual 7-segment display datasheet, the voltage drop across the segments are about 1.8 V. The input voltage is the voltage given by the transistor, which is 2.6 V.Given that the collector-emitter saturation voltage was 0.4 V and aiming for approximately 5 mA across the LEDs of the segments, the resistor value is:\n\\[\nR_{seg} = \\frac{(V_{PIN} - V_{CE,SAT}) - V_{seg}}{I_{seg}} = \\frac{(3.3V - 0.4V) - 1.8V}{0.005A} = 220 \\Omega\n\\]"

By looking at the code, this design seemed somewhat similar to what I did, and seemed like is functionable. However, this design did assume clk to be an external input, and kept the counter in the top level module instead of in an independent module. One thing that I like about its design was that it did include a parameter in the top level module, allowing easy changes to the frequency which the two digits toggle.\nFor the second prompt, since my counter module from Lab 1 was more than a clock divider and thus did not fit this purpose, I modified the prompt and asked it to:\n\nWrite SystemVerilog HDL to time multiplex a single seven segment decoder (that decodes from four bits to a common anode seven segment display) to decode two sets of input bits and drive two sets of seven output bits. Use the seven segment decoder provided in the attached files and the HSOSC from the iCE40UP library.\n\nThe thinking time of this prompt was around 30 seconds, which was two times longer than the thinking time of privious prompt. When synthesizing it, it got this error:\n\nError 35901282 Synthesis ERROR &lt;35901282&gt; - c:/users/user/desktop/engr 155/lab2/e155_lab2/fpga/radiant_project/ai_2/source/impl_1/top.sv(67): loop count limit exceeded forever never breaks. VERI-1282 [top.sv:67]\n\nThis error came from the ifdef-elsif-else statement which this design provide. ChatGPT said the purpose of it was to include common ways to instantiate an on-chip oscillator and allows the user to choose which one by using the `ifdef. However, it was pretty redundant and got stuck on its approach of instantiate the clock if there is no on-chip oscillator:\n\nforever #10 clk_hf = ~clk_hf;\n\nIt also made the same mistake of using SB_HFOSC instead of HSOSC in Lab 1. After asking it to remove the ifdef-elsif-else statement and assuming that the osciallator will be instantiate with one method, the new design was able to synthesize, and seemed like would work fine when I read through it."

    "text": "Design\nThe top level design, lab1_gt, included three modules: the on-board high-speed oscillator (HSOSC) from the iCE40 UltraPlus primitive library, a counter for the blinking LED, and a 7-segment display decoder. The general idea of the design can be visualized with the block diagram below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Block diagram of the FPGA design\n\n\n\nThe 7-segment display decoder simply contained a set of combinational logic to translate a 4-bit binary signal into a single hexadecimal value. Each segment of the display is a LED controlled by an I/O pin from the UPduino board, and the shape of each hexadecimal value is unique, which will later be demonstrated in the Results section of this page.\nThe LED decoder included combinational logic to assign led[0] and led[1] using the inputs switches[3:0]. According to Table 1, led[1] can simply be assigned through a XOR gate and led[0] through an AND gate. The module also takes in a 24 MHz clock input clk given by the high-speed oscillator. It then uses a counter incremented at each clock cycle to toggle led[2] every 5 million cycles, allowing the LED to blink at 2.4 Hz.\nOn the physical side of design, the 7-segment display was externally accessed on a breadboard. The switch used for inputs and the LEDs are soldered on the board provided by the course. The schematics for the physical circuit design is shown in the following graph:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Schematics of the circuit design\n\n\n\nA resistor value of \\(220 \\Omega\\) are chosen considering the voltage and current across the LEDs. According to the 7-segment display datasheet, the ideal current across the LEDs on the display should be 20mA. Given that \\(V = IR\\), a driving voltage of \\(3.3V\\) and a voltage drop of \\(2.1V\\) across red LEDs,\n\\[\nR = \\frac{3.3V - 2.1V}{0.02A} = 60 \\Omega\n\\]\nSince \\(220 \\Omega &gt; 60 \\Omega\\), a \\(220 \\Omega\\) resistor would allow the current to stay within the safety range and was tested to provide enough brightness."

    "text": "Testing and Results\nAt the beginning of the lab, we first had to solder the components onto the board. After soldering the board, I tested it with the Radiant tutorial provided on the course website and verified that the componenets are working as expected.\nThe led2_counter module, which is used to make one of the LEDs blink at 2.4 Hz, is hard to test through a testbench due to its use of high-frequency oscillators. Alternatively, we can directly verify its functionality using an oscilloscope to measure the frequency of the blinking LED. As shown in Figure 3, led[2] is indeed blinking at approximately 2.4 Hz, fitting the one of the requirements of the lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Oscilloscope result of frequency of blinking LED, led[2]\n\n\n\nSince the inputs were only four switches, or 16 combinations, the other two self-designed modules, lab1_gt and seven_seg_decoder, can be easily tested through automated testbenches. I wrote two testbenches, one for the top level module and the other for the seven segment display decoder, then created TV-file test vectors accordingly. Using Questa to simulate, the following figures show that both modules have successfully passed their testbench. Note that the led[2] is previously tested and can be neglected here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Waveform of the simulated top level module\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Ending statement showing no errors for top level module\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Testbench results for the top level module lab1_gt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Waveform of the simulated segment display module\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Ending statement showing no errors for segment display module\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Testbench results for the segment display module seven_seg_decoder\n\n\n\nAfter verifying the code with testbenches, the circuit which I built also has to be tested. The following video shows a completely demo of me trying all 16 combination of switch inputs on my system. As shown in the video, each combination of switches, relating to a single hexadecimal digit, has a unique pattern and was able to turn on successfully. On top of that, the three LEDs close to the left-bottom corner of the ribbon cable performed as expected. The two non-blinking LEDs, with the right one being led[0], worked according to the described logic of led[1] and led[0]. Although this video was sped up by 1.5 times, the blinking LED led[2] was blinking at the expected frequency of 2.4 Hz, as previously verified."

After putting in the promopt, it returned its first code which had this error and caused systhesis to fail:\nERROR &lt;35901063&gt; - c:/users/user/desktop/e155_lab1/fpga/radiant_project/ai/source/impl_1/top.sv(17): instantiating unknown module SB_HFOSC. VERI-1063 [top.sv:17]\nLooking at this error, I noticed that it was using a different module name compared to what we used, HSOSC, but I wasn’t sure if this module specified by chatGPT was actually available. However, I decided to simply throw in the error. ChatGPT insisted that SB_HFOSC was the right module, and repeatedly asked me to check my settings. At some point, it even threw in the idea of declaring the module as a black box with (* blackbox *), whicih also caused other trivial issues and was still unable to solve the root cause. Knowing that this is a rabbit hole, I decided to search up SB_HFOSC online and found the following information in the iCE40 Oscillator Usage Guide:\n\n1.1. Key Features The following oscillators are available to iCEcube2 users: SB_LFOSC – Low Frequency Oscillator, SB_HFOSC – High Frequency Oscillator with output divider The following oscillators are available to Lattice Radiant Software users: LSOSC – Low Frequency Oscillator, HSOSC – High Frequency Oscillator with output divider\n\nI gave this information back to ChatGPT, and it then returned another draft of the module, which passed systhesis this time.\nOverall, I would rate the experience for coding with ChatGPT a 5.5/10. It did help explaining the calculations and also drafting the code, but I feel never really felt confident in the things it produced and had to also do a self mental check. Personally, I feel more confident in debugging and finding the non-reasonable parts from a piece of code than writing one from scratch. In this case, for example, I was able to find the unfamiliar module from ChatGPT’s code and also think of ways to make the code cleaner, but that was also partially because I had prior knowledge to the prompt. This time, ChatGPT providing a somewhat feasible draft did help improve the work efficiency, thus I rated it an above average score. That being said, the quality of it’s code is not always consistent, and I would most likely suggest one to be fairly confident in the topic of the prompt before asking a LLM to code from scratch."

    "text": "Design\nThe top level design, lab3_gt, included multiple modules:\n\nThe on-board high-speed oscillator (HSOSC) from the iCE40 UltraPlus primitive library\nA keypad scanner to scan the keypad for presses and synchronize the input with a synchronizer\nA debouncer for debouncing check on presses and releases, waiting for 100 ms\nA main FSM to determine “an actual press” on the keypad, design described below\nA keypad decoder to translate the row and column pressed into a 4-bit binary number\nA digit selector to toggle or select between the digits shown on the display\nA 7-segment display decoder.\n\nThe general idea of the design can be visualized with the block diagram below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Block diagram of the FPGA design\n\n\n\nReused from lab 1 and 2, digitSelector selects the digit which will be displayed on the dual 7-segment display with 60 Hz and segDecoder translates a given 4-bit binary number into 7-segment displayable hexadecimal. The 60 Hz frequency was chosen such that the human eyes can not catch that the two digits are turning on and off, creating the illusion that both digits are always on at the same time. The module achieves such frequency by taking in a 6 MHz clock input clk given by the high-speed oscillator and using a counter incremented at each clock cycle to toggle the enabling signal for each digit at 60 Hz. It then outputs both enabling signals and the 4-bit binary of the digit with the enabled signal.\nThe 7-segment display decoder contains a set of combinational logic to translate a 4-bit binary signal into a single hexadecimal value. Each segment of the display is a LED controlled by an I/O pin from the UPduino board, and the shape of each hexadecimal value is unique. As per the constraint of this lab, this module is only used once and takes the 4-bit binary input of the selected digit given by digitSelector.\nThe main finite state machine, pressFSM, was designed with the following state transition diagrams:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: State transition diagram of the main FSM\n\n\n\nThis FSM includes four states: IDLE, DEBOUNCE, HOLD, and RELEASE. The IDLE state works with the keypad_scanner to look for any pressed key. The keypad scanner drives voltage through each column of the keypad repeatedly, from column 0 to column 3, and searches for a pressed key when a corresponding row is high. When a key press is detected, the FSM transition into DEBOUNCE, which sends a startDebounce signal to the debouncer and waits for the countDone signal. The countDone signal indicates that the debounce period (100 ms) has ended, confirming that the key is in fact pressed and allowing the FSM to transition into state HOLD. Note that if the press is no longer detected (active rows changed when the same column is driven), the DEBOUNCE state moves back to the IDLE state. In state HOLD, if the rows input of the column originally pressed changes, then the FSM enters state RELEASE. This state uses a similar method with DEBOUNCE to check whether a key is actually released. The FSM moves on to IDLE if the release is true, and moves back to HOLD if it thinks that the release was simply a debounce.\nIn terms of the circuitry design, similar to Lab 2, the dual 7-segment display was externally accessed on a breadboard, with each of its two common anode connected to a 2N3906 PNP transistor to provide enough current. The 4-by-4 keypad matrix was also externally connected, with a pull-down resistor of \\(680 \\ohm\\) connecting the rows to ground. Given the large \\(100 k \\ohm\\) internal pull-up resistors in the PCB provided by the course, this pull-down resistor was chosen to be small enough to prevent the presence of a voltage divider. Two LEDs, D7 and D8, on the PCB are also used to show the states which the FSM is in, mainly for debugging purposes. The schematics for the physical circuit design is shown in the following graph:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Schematics of the circuit design"

A synthesis error said that new_key is constantly driven from multiple places. Therefore, I asked it to fix it. Its second try also did not synthesize successfully, where there was a syntax error around always_ff. I also feeded back this error, and ChatGPT somehow came to the conclusion that my Lattice Radiant toolchain is not set up for full SystemVerilog-2005/2012 features. Later on, it decided to change its syntax to Verilog-2001 in its third try, which passed synthesis. The code it produced looks functionable at first sight. However, some of its choices, such as not having an else statement for the next state logic in FSM made me question whether this design would really work in real world.\nFor the second approach of using modular prompts, after tailoring the port names of my seven-segment decoder into the code which ChatGPT produced, synthesis passed the first time. The general logic between the two prompts seemed similar, but the second prompt has a cleaner code and design. For example, the FSM of the second prompt had only 3 states whereas the first one had 4. The second prompt merged the press and release debounce into one. Similarly though, I still don’t like the fact that there is no else statements for the next state logic.\nDespite their uncertainty of capabilities, the prompts were able to generate synthesizable designs fairly fast enough."

By counting both the rising and falling edges of both encoder A and B, each pulse is equivalent to 4 trigger events, and thus the rotational speed, in rev/s, can be given by: \\[\nV_{rot} = \\frac{count_{trigger}}{4*408}\n\\]\nI used libraries provided by the course for setting up most of the MCU. However, I reused the timer functions which I created in lab 4, since I was more familiar with its prescalar calculations. Referencing the STM32L432KC reference manual, programming manual, and datasheet, I was able to utilize functions to set up and enable the interrupts. Specifically, PA9 for encoder A and PA10 for encoder B was chosen as they were 5V compatible.\nTo enable the interrupts and correctly handle them, I wrote the functions EXTI9_5_IRQHandler and EXTI15_10_IRQHandler, respectively for PA9 and PA10. The handlers should update (increase or decrease) the count of triggers and determine the direction of the rotation. From observation, it can be seen that which ever encoder came first for each rotating direction has high on rising edge and low on falling, whereas the other encoder is a low and high, respectively. On the other hand, which ever came the later for each rotating direction had both encoders on high or low when there is an edge. Using such logic, we can find the direction which the motor is spinning by reading the input pins when interrupts happen. The flow chart for the interrupt design is described in the following picture:\n\n\n\nFlow chart of interrupt design\n\n\nThen, for every 1 second delay, the device prints the rotation speed and direction which the motor is spinning.\nThe circuitry design was referenced from the motor datasheet attached above, and no additional components were connected.

When the motor is turned off, the outputted motor speed is then 0. At both high and low speed, the device showed a steady output of reasonable motor speed.\nTo compare the performaces between interrupts and manual polling, I disabled the interrupt and toggled a pin for when each loop of my while loop is being ran, providing the motor a voltage of 10.02 V. The output is shown in the graph below:\n\n\n\nOscilloscope trace of polling output at 10.02V\n\n\nThe toggled pin had a frequency of 7.81 kHz. The maximum motor speed which it should be able to detect is thus: \\[\n\\omega_{max, pol} = \\frac{7.81 * 10^3 \\ Hz}{408 \\ rev^{-1}} \\approx 19.14 \\  rev/s\n\\]\nThis made sense since when I tried to gate and use polling, the device also outputted correct motor speed even up until 4 rev/s. As for the interrupt, using a function generator, I found that the device can no longer output the correct frequency which it was receiving at around 13 kHz. Therefore, the maximum motor speed it should be able to detect is: \\[\n\\omega_{max, int} = \\frac{13 * 10^3 \\ Hz}{408 \\ rev^{-1}} \\approx 31.86 \\  rev/s\n\\]\nThe interrupt would thus work better at a high speed."

After providing it the link to the header file of the device, however, it was able to generate correct syntax by using bit masking. At this point, the general logic of enabling and handling the interrupt seemed fine, but as it was not specified in the prompt, the code was missing parts that would calculate and output the motor speed. Interestingly, after asking for calculating and outputting the motor speed, ChatGPT once again generated new code with the wrong syntax, similar to those before the header file was provided.
